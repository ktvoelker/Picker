A re-usable console-based interactive file chooser

* Search-as-you-type

  * Use the algorithm that was planned (and implemented?) for Di?

* Works with Git

  * Ignores files based on .gitignore

    * Use git status --porcelain FILENAME to determine if a file is ignored?

  * Can search under the entire git root from anywhere

* Provide a vim plugin to run this program and open the chosen file
